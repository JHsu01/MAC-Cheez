# How to use:

Test.cpp has multiple functions critical to Alice and Bob's goals. It allows the user to encypt (using RSA) and decrypt inputs. It also allows for a file to be hashed by the SHA 256 Algorithm. In addition, it also generates a new public and private key if needed. The bash functions included in this resporitory are simply for sending documents over IP & port. 

In theory, bob and alice will both take their file, hash it, and encrypt the hash. They will then send the encrypted ciphertext it to each other's IP adress. The other party will then decrypt the ciphertext with their private key, then compare the hash generated.
